of username, underscore, serial number (or incremental), or could be randomized series of numbers)

Username=uname

Password=psw

Email=eml

Phone=phone;

active (boolean that identifies whether the account has been deactivated or not. Its good practice for records
to instead of delete the account, just to use a boolean to state that the account has been deactivated, this can
also be used when changing information, deactivate the account with old information and create a new one with
the new information (and transfer over any information)
