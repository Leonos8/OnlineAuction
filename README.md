Password is case sensitive. Run Apache Tomcat V9 server, then run the LoginPage.jsp file. This will open up the Login Page. The create account feature is being put on hold until Part 3, so you needn't worry about that. Simply log in and you can log out by hovering over the user icon, then clicking log out

You can ignore the CreateAccount.jsp, some of the empty methods in DBSQL, and the Notes folder. Those are all relative to Part 3
